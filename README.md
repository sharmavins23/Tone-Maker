# Tone Maker

This project is a simple song generator. Feed in a string designating how the
song should go, and the tone maker will make that song as a .wav file.

Currently, strings can be encoded such as:

`C4 C4 B4 B4 A4 A4 0 0 C4 C4 B4 B4 A4 A4 0 0`

This string will generate hot cross buns. As we can see, the generator only
handles eighth notes. However, the BPM setting allows it to feasibly handle any
division of 2 by simply changing that value.

# To-Do

The following is a list of short, simple issues that can be fixed but I can't
put the time into them immediately.

-   Fix the clipping issue on the end of notes - The final sine wave of a note
    should be tapered down or dampened such that this clipping does not occur
-   Add the ability to expand notes to multiple "beats" without any gaps
-   Add the ability to combine songs together as song fragments, which should
    allow for songs to be made up of other groupings of songs. This allows for
    time signatures to be mixed, songs to speed up and slow down, etc
-   Add the capability to make chords
-   Create a simple UI that allows for song generation
-   Optimize code. There's many points for optimization - A lot of the tones
    are generated on runtime instead of being switched to usage, and this
    could optimize the song generation time significantly for longer songs
